Abstract:
Software Pass is an innovative decentralized marketplace that aims to revolutionize the way software rights are managed and owned. In the current software industry, the distribution and licensing of software are typically centralized, which can lead to various challenges such as piracy, lack of
transparency, and limited control for software developers and users. The Software Pass project seeks to address these issues by leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts to create a secure, transparent, and user-centric marketplace for software ownership.

Benefits:
•	Developers can protect their intellectual property and receive fair compensation for their software creations.
•	Users gain access to a wider range of software options, easily purchase licenses, and ensure they are using genuine and legally acquired software.
•	Enhanced security and transparency reduce the risk of malware and unauthorized usage.
•	The elimination of intermediaries reduces costs for both developers and users.
•	The platform fosters a vibrant community of software creators and consumers


Software Pass utilizes a combination of cutting-edge technologies to achieve its goals as a decentralized marketplace for owning software rights. The key technologies used in the project include:
1.	Blockchain:
2.	Smart Contracts : done using Solidity Programming
3.	Ethereum : Blockchain Platform
4.	Wallets: MetaMask Wallet
5.	Web3.js
6.	Front-end Library: React.js
